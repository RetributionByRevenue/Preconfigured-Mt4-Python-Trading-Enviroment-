The purpose of this github is to provide a solution to the biggest problem currently in the forex market, and that issue is algo trading!

I also made a youtube video tutorial with complete walkthrough how to operate the code:

Most forex brokers do not have their own custom api and only provide their own version of Metatrader 4 for traders to interface with. Metatrader 4/Metatrader 5 is an outdated windows xp era forex trading software that is rather difficult to use AND especially frustrating to program for!!!


The journey of becoming a competent forex algo trader was brutal(devastating at times), required lots of trial and error, and is difficult. However, the problems I and many others in my shoes have faced can be solved to some degree when using Python as a base programing language instead of the garbage MQL4(Metatrader 4) programing language. Assuming you have a strategy in mind to test or have a profitable trading strategy written in Python, the downloaded files will allow users to place trades very simply to Metatrader 4. Furthermore, I’m assuming that most people I am helping here are new to programming or algo trading in general, so I organized everything to be simple to understand.

How it works? I have configured PORTABLE/CONTAINERIZED versions of Python3 and Metatrader 4 environments to demonstrate an easy solution to send orders to mt4 using Python. In simple terms, you just need to download the files and run the programs. Due to the nature of these portable environments I have configured, there is no need for any installing of any kind. It is simple to use and possibly a great way for new people to get into forex or algo trading. You can even run the files on a USB or in a Dropbox folder giving many computers you own the ability to algo trade without the need of installing python or metatrader.
Just load spyder.exe and terminal.exe and you are ready to start algo trading.


What is the catch? Only works on windows only. You can use wine to emulate on mac/linux but support is hit or miss.
